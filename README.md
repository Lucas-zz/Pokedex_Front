## About

<p>This project as a part of a coding challenge for an Entry-level Frontend role in <a href="https://www.voltbras.com.br/">Voltbras</a>.</p>
<p>I had a really great time implementing this application. I hope that you, who's reading this right now, can also enjoy. üòÅ</p>

---

## How It Works

<p>It's really simple, you just have to click <a href="https://pokedex-lucas-zz.vercel.app/" target="_blank">here</a> to open the deployed application and start using!</p>
<p>After loading, you can check the boxes for each type on the filter to start seeing the pok√©mons being listed!</p>
<p>You can also shorten your search even more by using the slider to show pok√©mons only in that range of Max CP.</p>
<p>And that's it!</p>
<h5>In the future, new features might be implemented! Stay tuned.</h5>

## Pre-requisites

Before you begin, you will need to have the following tools installed on your machine:
[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), [Git](https://git-scm.com), [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

### Intial configs

``` jsx

// Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/Lucas-zz/Pokedex_Front.git

// Access the project folder cmd/terminal
$ cd Pokedex_Front

// Install the dependencies
$ npm install

```

After this, you can start using the scripts below.

---

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

**Note: not implemente yet!**

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.

You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.
